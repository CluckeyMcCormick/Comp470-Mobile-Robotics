# Comp470-Mobile-Robotics
Personal repository for code from my COMP 470 Mobile Robotics class.

This repository is kind of a mess - since it was mostly just unstructured class work.

However, the real meat of the code can be found in the zz_main folder. That is where you will find the code actually used in my robot.

The zz_main_alt folder presents a more lightweight version of the code. We actually had to print out and then hand in our code at the end of the class; my code was too long to be printed out - so I rewrote it into a very barebones version.
